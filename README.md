Small app developed in React.

This is a news client that consumes the api [NewsApi.org](https://newsapi.org).

For its development it has been used:
* Class Components
* Stateless Components
* Async / await fuctions
* Promises
* Fecht API

This app belongs to my humble Front-End development portfolio.

To use the api you need a free account on newsapi.org and get a token to consume the api.
That token you must place in the .env.example file and rename the file to .env

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
